*1. What is the difference between `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface?*

* `Thread` is a class that can be extended to create a thread.
* `Runnable` is a functional interface that can be implemented to define thread behavior.
* Since Java supports only single inheritance, using `Runnable` is often preferred to allow the class to extend another class.

*2. How do you create a thread in Java? Explain with an example.*

You can create a thread in two ways:

* By extending the `Thread` class.
* By implementing the `Runnable` interface.

[source, java]
----
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
    }
}
----

*3. What is the difference between `start()` and `run()` methods in a thread?*

* `start()` creates a new thread and invokes the `run()` method.
* `run()` just executes the code in the current thread like a normal method call.

*4. What are the different thread states in Java?*

Java threads have the following states (from `Thread.State` enum):

* NEW
* RUNNABLE
* BLOCKED
* WAITING
* TIMED_WAITING
* TERMINATED

*5. What is the purpose of the `synchronized` keyword in Java?*

* It is used to restrict access to a block of code or method by multiple threads.
* It prevents thread interference and memory consistency errors.

[source, java]
----
public synchronized void myMethod() {
    // Only one thread can access this method at a time
}
----

*6. What is a daemon thread? How is it different from a user thread?*

* A daemon thread runs in the background and is used for tasks like garbage collection.
* The JVM exits when only daemon threads are running, unlike user threads.

[source, java]
----
Thread t = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Daemon thread"));
t.setDaemon(true);
t.start();
----

*7. What is the difference between `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`?*

* `wait()` pauses the thread and releases the lock.
* `notify()` wakes up one waiting thread.
* `notifyAll()` wakes up all waiting threads.
* All must be called from within a synchronized context.

*8. What is thread deadlock and how can you prevent it?*

* Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks.
* Prevention techniques:
  - Avoid nested locks
  - Use lock ordering
  - Try using `tryLock()` from `java.util.concurrent.locks`

*9. What is the `volatile` keyword in Java? How is it different from `synchronized`?*

* `volatile` ensures that changes made by one thread to a variable are visible to other threads.
* It does not block threads, unlike `synchronized`.
* It is suitable only for variables (not blocks/methods) and does not guarantee atomicity.

*10. How does Java achieve thread safety?*

* By using:
  - `synchronized` blocks/methods
  - `volatile` keyword
  - Atomic variables (`AtomicInteger`, etc.)
  - Thread-safe classes like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`

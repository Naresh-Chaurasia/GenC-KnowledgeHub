== Springboot V/s Spring Framework

*Overview*

* *Spring Framework*: A powerful and flexible framework for building Java enterprise applications with support for dependency injection, web, data, transactions, security, etc. Requires manual setup.
* *Spring Boot*: A convention-over-configuration extension of Spring that simplifies application setup by providing auto-configuration and prebuilt dependencies.

*Comparison Table*

|===
| Feature | Spring Framework | Spring Boot

| Setup & Configuration
| Requires XML/Java config files for setup; more boilerplate
| Auto-configuration, minimal setup; quick project startup

| Dependencies
| Manually list all Spring dependencies
| Starter dependencies (`spring-boot-starter-*`) simplify dependency management

| Application Startup
| Requires a `web.xml` or manual Spring container setup
| Uses embedded servers (e.g. Tomcat) — run app via `main()` directly

| Auto-Configuration
| You explicitly configure beans and components
| Spring Boot auto-configures common beans based on classpath and properties

| Learning Curve
| Steeper; must understand Spring Core concepts thoroughly
| Easier for beginners due to sensible defaults and starter guides

| Build & Deploy
| Requires traditional WAR/EAR packaging and deployment to external servers
| Packs as a self-contained executable JAR; can also produce WAR if needed

| Configuration
| `applicationContext.xml` or Java config classes
| `application.properties` or `application.yml` for centralized config

| Opinionated Defaults
| Requires you to make most decisions yourself
| Gives you production-ready defaults that you can override

| Microservices Support
| Can build microservices manually but requires extra setup
| Designed for microservices and cloud-native apps; integrates easily with Spring Cloud
|===

*When to Use Spring Framework*

* You need fine-grained control over all configurations.
* You already have a legacy application built on Spring.
* You want to pick and choose each Spring dependency manually.

*When to Use Spring Boot*

* You want rapid development with minimal setup.
* You’re creating new microservices or cloud-native apps.
* You prefer convention-over-configuration and embedded servers.
* You want production-ready features like Actuator, metrics, and health checks by default.

*Conclusion*

Both Spring Framework and Spring Boot are powerful. Spring Framework gives you flexibility and granular control, while Spring Boot simplifies the setup and is ideal for quickly starting production-grade applications, especially microservices.

== Microservices with Spring Boot

* Quick setup and minimal configuration — Spring Boot simplifies creating REST APIs with built-in starter dependencies (spring-boot-starter-web), so you don’t have to manually configure all the Spring Web MVC beans.

* Embedded server support — Spring Boot includes an embedded Tomcat/Jetty server, so you can run your REST app as a simple main() method without worrying about an external server.

* Auto-configuration — Spring Boot auto-configures JSON converters, exception handling, content negotiation, etc. that most REST apps need.

* Production-ready — Features like Actuator, metrics, and health checks come out of the box, making it easier to deploy and monitor your REST API.

* Microservices-ready — Spring Boot integrates seamlessly with Spring Cloud if you want to scale up to microservices architecture.
